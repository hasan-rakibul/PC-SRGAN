The files having 'SRGAN_' prefix in 'src' folder refer to the original codes, which are licensed under the Apache License 2.0,. 
Other codes are written by Md Rakibul Hasan unless otherwise stated within the file.
The collected original codes are modified to implement physics-informed neural network in modelling fluid flow.
Some of the major modifications include:

- Adapted to use completely different dataset (i.e., fluid dynamics data) and modified the code accordingly.
- Added support for 'npy' file input.
- Added support for 1-channel image input.
- Added support for older GPU (e.g., P100) as the original code was failed to run with `triton` compiler.
- Physics-based loss functions are implemented and added in training code.
- Code of evaluation metrics, such as PSNR and SSIM are updated and accommodated in testing code.
