This project includes modifications to the original code, which is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Major modifications include:

- Used completely different dataset (i.e., fluid dynamics data) and modified the code accordingly.
- Added support for older GPU (e.g., P100) as the original code was failed to run with `triton` compiler.
